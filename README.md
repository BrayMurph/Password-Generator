# Password Generator Assignment 



## Details of the Assignment
I have made a password generator in which it has prompts in which the user can choose how many characters they want in their password, from 8 to 128 character. They will be able to then choose lowercase letters, uppercase letters, special characters, and numbers in their password if they so choose. Afterwards the password will then be randomly generated as in the photo of the website shown below.
